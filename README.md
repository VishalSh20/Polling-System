# Intervue.IO Internship Assignment â€“ Frontend

This is the **frontend** submission for the Intervue.IO internship assignment. It is a modern, real-time polling web application that allows teachers to create and manage polls, and students to participate in live sessions. The frontend is built with React and Vite, and communicates with a Node.js/Express backend over REST and Socket.io.

## Features

- **Live Polling:** Teachers can create questions, students can answer in real-time
- **Poll Results:** View live and past poll results with visual feedback
- **Kick Functionality:** Teachers can remove participants from the session
- **Real-time Chat:** Sidebar chat for all participants
- **Toast Notifications:** Feedback for join/kick events
- **Redux State Management:** With persistence for smooth UX
- **Loading Indicators:** For actions like poll submission
- **PropTypes:** Used throughout for type safety
- **Responsive UI:** Styled with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite-react
